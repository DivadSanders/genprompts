What Exactly is a Cheat Sheet?
A cheat sheet is a short, typically 1–2 page document that summarizes the key information, facts, steps, or concepts related to a specific topic. It acts as a quick reference guide, checklist, or simplified introductory resource on a subject.

Cheat sheets help simplify complex information for readers by breaking it down into the most vital elements.

Some defining features of effective cheat sheets include:

Short— They contain brief text focused only on need-to-know information. Bullet points and checklists are commonly used.
Scannable — Content is organized with headers, bullets, and visuals so readers can quickly skim and absorb the information.
Visual — Icons, charts, tables, and other graphics help convey concepts visually for better memorability.
Condensed — Cheat sheets condense a broad topic down to its core elements, typically fitting on 1–2 pages.
Actionable — They provide instructions, steps, or a checklist so readers can take action on the subject.
Informative — The goal is to educate readers on essential info to perform a task or understand a concept.
Accessible — The simplified format makes complex topics more accessible to beginners.
Overall, a well-designed cheat sheet makes learning or referencing key material on a topic much easier for readers. The one-page condensed format provides immense value.

Cheat Sheet Use Cases
Cheat sheets can cover a wide range of applications. Common uses include:

Software tutorials — List keyboard shortcuts, interface guides, step-by-step workflows
Process overviews — Summarize stages of a methodology at a glance
Study guides — Provide key facts before an exam in a simplified format
Job aids — Give employees quick access to policies, instructions, or standards
Marketing guides — Share the latest tips, stats, and best practices
DIY instructions — Provide steps for completing projects or recipes
Benefits of Creating Cheat Sheets
Cheat sheets offer many benefits both for creators and their audience:

Demonstrate expertise on niche topics
Establish authority and thought leadership
Showcase the ability to simplify complex information
Help users efficiently digest and apply knowledge
Versatile as lead magnets, free resources, or paid products
Cheat sheets are simple yet powerful one-pager reference guides. Beginners and experts can benefit from their concise, focused format on nearly any topic or niche imaginable.

5 Reasons Why You Should Create Cheat Sheets
I’m a sucker for those 5-minute DIY craft videos. The things I have learned to do with a hot glue gun would make your head spin. Those videos taught me that people like learning minus the fluff.

No long preambles or complicated instructions. Give steps 1–10 so users can implement what was learned immediately.

Here’s why you should consider adding cheat sheets to your list of products:

In Demand Across Many Niches
The simplified one-page reference format has universal appeal. Cheat sheets are handy resources on topics from marketing tactics to content creation tips. There is a healthy demand for them in every niche.
Use as Lead Magnets
Cheat sheets make excellent lead magnets to grow your email list. Give away your cheat sheet in exchange for an email address to convert website visitors into subscribers you can market to.
Easy and Fast to Produce
You don’t need fancy technology or in-depth research to create a quality cheat sheet. The simplified format means you can research and assemble one much faster than a 50-page ebook.
Branding Potential
Cheat sheets allow you to reinforce your brand. Maintain consistent colors, fonts, and visuals across all your cheat sheets.
Shareable on Social Media
The digestible one-page format makes cheat sheets extremely social media-friendly. Share them natively on platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn to spread your brand.
Cheat sheets check many boxes as valuable yet straightforward digital products. The combination of simplicity, utility, and flexibility makes them a prime choice to create for your business and audience.

How to Choose a Profitable Cheat Sheet Niche
Selecting the right niche is crucial to creating cheat sheets that resonate with users and drive sales.

Follow this process to identify lucrative categories worth exploring:

Research Audience Needs
Explore the audiences you want to serve to identify their biggest questions, problems, and knowledge gaps.

Explore Google Trends, Pinterest Trends and Answer Socrates to see common topics discussed across the internet. What are people asking for help with?
Check Amazon book bestsellers for popular informational topics.
Use Google’s autocomplete and related searches to find keywords people search for within your niche.
Choose areas where people clearly need educational resources. Cheat sheets on fast and new technology are a great place to start.

In the past 6 months, I have seen hundreds of ChatGPT cheat sheets across the internet. That’s because AI and prompt engineering is relatively new to the public. Low understanding and high intrigue are the perfect cross.

Consider Your Expertise
Leverage your own knowledge and interests when selecting a niche. Some ideas:

Previous jobs or education
Hobbies or skills
Life experiences
What content do you enjoy creating?
It’s easier to create compelling cheat sheets quickly when you already have expertise in a niche.

Choose a Specific Focus
Rather than a broad niche like “marketing”, focus your cheat sheet on a specific aspect like “Instagram marketing” or “copywriting tips”.

The more targeted your topic, the better.

Validate Demand
Before spending time creating a cheat sheet, validate demand.

Share a social post polling your audience on their interest in the niche or summarizing key points and see if it gets engagement.

By narrowing in on profitable niches where people want cheat sheet-style guides on focused topics aligned with your knowledge— you can develop valuable resources readers will love.

How to Create Compelling Cheat Sheet Content
Once you’ve chosen a profitable niche, it’s time to create awesome cheat sheet content.

Proper formatting transforms your content into an eye-catching and easy-to-use reference guide.

Follow these cheat sheet formatting best practices:

Use an Online Design Tool
I’ve said it before, but Canva is the GOAT!

It’s simple for anyone to create professional, polished documents without advanced design skills.

The drag-and-drop functionality and ready-made templates, make it easy:

Insert and format text
Add charts, icons, and visuals
Align elements
Change colors
AI-generated images
This enables you to create branded cheat sheets that establish you as an expert. But if design is not your strong suit, try Google Docs instead!

Focus on Skimmability
Leverage bullet points, numbered lists, headers, and bold text to highlight key information so readers can skim quickly.

Break content down into small digestible chunks.

Balance Text and Visuals
Find a 50/50 balance between text-based and visual content.

Too much dense text is difficult to scan. Too many visuals without context is overwhelming.

Aim for an integrated mix of both.

Use Succinct Text
Write copy in short, scannable bullet points rather than lengthy paragraphs.

For example:

Keep bullet points under 20 words
Use active voice for clarity
Include one key insight per bullet
Identify the Core Concepts
Review existing material on your topic to determine the 5–10 most vital concepts, facts, statistics, or steps to include. Resist cramming in too much. Focus on need-to-know info.

How to Price and Monetize Your Cheat Sheets
Once you’ve created an amazing cheat sheet, it’s time to leverage it to generate profit.

Here are effective monetization strategies:

Sell Directly
You can sell your cheat sheet as a digital download directly through:

Your own website or blog
eCommerce platforms like Gumroad or Lemon Squeezy
Creative marketplaces like Etsy or CreativeMarket
Price based on factors like:

Your audience’s ability to pay
The perceived value of the knowledge
Competitor pricing for similar products
Your goals (maximize sales or profit)
Typically $5-$15 works for most informational cheat sheets.

Offer as a Lead Magnet
Give away your cheat sheet in exchange for an email address to rapidly grow your email subscriber list.

Popular email course platforms include:

ConvertKit
Beehiiv
Aweber
MailerLite
Email Octopus
You can then monetize this audience over time through back-end offers, affiliate promotions, paid products, and more.

Sell Cheat Sheet Creation Service
If you excel at researching and creating cheat sheets quickly, offer it as a service. Find clients who need informational guides created for their brand or products.

Set pricing based on difficulty, hours required, and client budget.

Create Recurring “Update” Packages
Offer monthly or quarterly cheat sheet update packages. Provide updated versions with new stats, tips, and visuals to keep it evergreen.

The easiest way to do this is with shareable links.

The downside to selling your cheat sheets as a PDF or image file is the inability to update or add new information. The ultimate secret for selling your cheat sheets is with a shareable link.

Platforms like Notion and Google Docs allow users to share direct links to their workspaces.

Instead of creating your cheat sheet in Canva, input all of your cheat sheet information onto Notion and include the link to your workspace when you make your sale.

This way you can sell your cheat sheets as a subscription with new details added over time.

How to Promote Your Cheat Sheets Effectively
Creating amazing cheat sheets is only the first step. You also need to master promotion to get them in front of your target audience.

Here are effective strategies for cheat sheet promotion:

Content Marketing
Turn your cheat sheet topic into a long-form piece of content like a blog post or video.

Then link to the full cheat sheet as a downloadable asset for readers. Content marketing gives readers a taste of your knowledge before accessing the cheat sheet.

Repurpose and Recycle
Repurpose your cheat sheet content into social posts, graphics, excerpts, videos, podcast clips etc.

Maximize reuse!

Cheat sheets are so versatile.

Check out this design resources cheat sheet by designer UI Adrian:

Instead of taking a screenshot of a PDF and posting it on Twitter, Adrian branded their cheat sheet. They categorized the best design resources online and created a slideshow to share on Twitter.

Yes, I know… they’re a professional designer so of course it looks great.

But you can do this too!

When transforming your cheat sheet into a piece of content, remember these key design principles:

Use contrasting colors, fonts, etc. to make key elements stand out
Make important text larger or bolder to draw attention
Repeat colors, fonts, etc. to create a consistent look
Leave breathing room between elements for an uncluttered look
Add diverse visual styles to keep things interesting
You can see UI Adrian’s Twitter shared cheat sheet carousel hits all of these design principles. With the right distribution — your cheat sheets will reach and benefit your target audience.

With the right strategic approach, cheat sheets are an easy yet highly effective way to demonstrate expertise, capture leads, and bolster your business.

Start small, collaborate, seek feedback, and relentlessly promote. Now get out there and start creating some game-changing cheat sheets!

TITLE: 5 No Sweat Digital Products Every Solopreneur Can Launch This Week
SUBTITLE: All you need is a Google Doc and Gumroad account!

In the world of digital entrepreneurship, creating content products can be a great way to generate revenue and provide value to your audience.

However, with so many options available, it can be difficult to decide which types of content products to create.

Here are 5 digital products that solopreneurs should add to their stores:

5–7 Day Email Course
What’s every solopreneur's favorite word?

Automation.

Every one-person business needs to leverage the power of automated systems to create more, build faster, and stay connected with its audience.

An email course is a hands-off product you can create over a weekend.

Khalid (@itskhalid_A) provides a 5-day educational email course developed for video marketing agencies. The course is sent over the span of 5 emails with each email teaching a new lesson.

Once someone signs up for the course, the series of emails are sent automatically on the schedule you decide.

Compared to creating a fully online course, email courses are much easier to produce and send out. They don’t require a fancy website, just an email marketing platform, and some creativity.

How to create your own email course:

Choose the right tools: To send your emails out to students, you will need an email marketing tool, landing page, and opt-in form. Ideally, you would want all three provided through the same platform.
Brainstorm topic ideas: Your email course should complement the products you currently sell. Keep it in line with the information you are an expert on. You will get more buy-in from your audience that way.
Consider what you want to achieve: Is the course an upsell to a bigger product? Do you want to lead students to further consultations? Having business goals will keep the course headed in the right direction.
Select your course length and frequency: Most email courses are 5–7 days. But this depends entirely on you. How many emails will you send and often will you send them? I suggest a 5-day course to get started.
Develop an email template: Most email marketing platforms will have a template you can use to structure your email. You want every email in the series to be uniform and from the same brand.
Create your emails: Keep paragraphs short, give valuable information, and send emails simultaneously during the sequence. Treat your email course as an actual class. You don’t need a degree to be a teacher.
Email courses are meant to be as valuable as any full-blown. In fact, they can be a powerful way to monetize your knowledge and expertise.

Don’t limit yourself to using them as a freebie — consider adding email courses to your product suite and watch your revenue grow.

Tools you'll need:

1. Email Octopus: send automated emails
2. Pretty Funnels: plan email sequence
3. Notion: archive lessons and notes
Ebook w/ Updates
Ebooks have been a classic content product for years because they are so easy to make.

Create an ebook on any topic
Sell as a PDF
Tons of platforms you can design your ebook
Relatively easy to distribute
They continue to be a popular option for entrepreneurs looking to create informative and valuable content for their audience.

You can create an ebook on any topic, from business strategy to personal development.

Consider adding visuals and graphics to help break up the text and make the content more visually appealing.

But it’s 2023. Although ebooks are still a viable product for solopreneurs, they can be upgraded to produce more income:

On top of selling your ebook through your business store, try self-publishing for free on Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing.
Instead of a static document that never changes, sell it as a monthly subscription with new materials added over time. Sell the link to the doc instead of the doc itself, that way you can update over time.
Join affiliate programs and include affiliate links where appropriate. The links you include should lead to tools that enhance the information.
Tools you'll need:

1. Google Docs: create ebook document
2. Notion: create ebook document
3. Gumroad: sell ebook and links
Niche-Specific Operating System (OS)
Operating systems are a powerful way to provide value to your audience. People crave structure and systems, and by creating an operating system for a specific niche, you can provide your audience with a proven framework to follow.

To create an operating system, start by identifying a niche that is not yet structured, and then build a framework around it. This could involve creating templates, workflows, or step-by-step guides.

I know an “operating system” sounds advanced and expensive to create.

But that’s only to keep people from attempting to make their own and flooding the market.

The easiest way to think about an operating system is as a programmatic approach to doing a specific task.

Figure out one thing you are really good at and that you have a tried-and-true technique to accomplish.

It can be as simple as a Notion template to consistently hit your goals.

Other examples:

An operating system to manage your mornings
An operating system to supercharge your mental health
An operating system to plan and track your academic life
An operating system to organize your content creation
An operating system to launch and grow a startup
By providing a clear system for your audience to follow, you can help them achieve their goals with an easy-to-follow framework.

Tools you'll need:

1. Notion: create operating system
2. Lemon Squeezy: sell product
Cheat Sheets
To create a cheat sheet, start by identifying a problem that your audience faces regularly, and then provide them with a quick and easy solution.

Cheatsheets can be a great lead magnet or a low-cost product you can offer your audience.

Don’t overthink this one:

Start with a problem
Create a list of ways to solve it
Include visuals (optional)
Cheatsheets have the lowest barrier to entry of any digital product. They can be in the form of a checklist, guide, tutorial, or infographic.

By creating a cheat sheet on a specific topic, you can save your audience time and effort by providing them with essential theory, actionable guides, and memorable visuals all in one place.

Tools you'll need:

1. Writesonic: ideas for audience problems
2. Google Docs: create cheat sheet
3. Gumroad: sell cheat sheet
Personal Swipe File
Swipe files are specific to marketers. We use them to collect copywriting and advertising inspiration we see online. Hence the “swipe.”

When you create and consume content as much as I do, a swipe file is essential.

Here’s a swipe file I created for first-generation founders:

Swipe files are a valuable resource for your audience.

By creating a curated list of the best content related to a specific topic, you can provide your audience with inspiration and ideas that they can use to create their own content.

To create a swipe file, start by collecting the best content related to a specific topic, and then share it with your audience.

This can be done through a blog post, social media post, or even as a download. By providing your audience with a curated list of the best content, you can save them time and effort and build a loyal following.

Tools you'll need:

1. Notion: create swipe file
2. Gumroad: sell swipe file
Additional tips:
Consider creating a bundle of content products to offer your audience a variety of options and value.
Don’t be afraid to experiment with different formats and styles to find what works best for you and your audience.
Remember, you’re selling information, not pretty design work. Spend more time providing valuable knowledge than making visuals.
Creating content products can be a great way for solopreneurs to generate revenue and provide value to their audience.

By considering these five digital products in 2023, you can provide your audience with the knowledge, inspiration, and community they need to achieve their goals.
